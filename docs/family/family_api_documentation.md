## 17. Family Support Reward Distribution (Cron)

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at midnight (configured via `FAMILY_SUPPORT_REWARD` cron)

**Not an API endpoint** — this is a background job.

### How It Works

1. Fetches all configured reward levels (sorted by level ascending)
2. Gets last week's family ranking (families with gifts)
3. For each qualifying family:
   - Selects the highest level where `totalContribution >= targetPoints`
   - Checks for duplicate payout (history lookup by family + weekStart)
   - Fetches weekly contributors (top 20 by `totalCoinCost`)
   - Excludes the leader from top contributors (leader gets paid separately)
   - Credits coins to eligible members (must meet `minContributionRequired`)
   - Creates a history record

### Payout Structure

| Role | Payment |
|---|---|
| Leader | `leaderCut` amount (if weekly contribution >= minContributionRequired) |
| Top 1 (non-leader) | `top1Cut` |
| Top 2 (non-leader) | `top2Cut` |
| Top 3 (non-leader) | `top3Cut` |
| Ranks 4-10 | `top4To10Cut` each |
| Ranks 11-15 | `top11To15Cut` each |
| Ranks 16-20 | `top16To20Cut` each |

### Deduplication

- A history record is created per family per week
- If a history record exists for the same `familyId` + `weekStart`, the family is skipped
- If the job crashes after crediting coins but before creating history, double-payment is possible on retry (narrow window)
